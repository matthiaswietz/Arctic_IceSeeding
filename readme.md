This repo describes microbial and checmial anaylses from Cardozo et al. (DOI). Here, we studied the seeding of microbes and molecules form Arctic sea-ice to seawater during sea-ice melt. We used ribosomal metabarcoding to assess microeukaryotic and prokaryotic community dynamics. FT-ICR-MS identifed chemcial compounds in sea-ice and meltwater. Raw sequence data is available at ENA under BioProject XYZ.

Analyses were carried out using the following scripts & input files:
-- Rmarkdowns describing primer-clipping and ASV generation; for both 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons
-- Rscript for ASV and metadata processing, alpha-diversity calculations
 -- Rscript for generation of manuscript figures
-- Rscript for generation of supplementary figures
-- Metadata and environmental parameters as .txt files
