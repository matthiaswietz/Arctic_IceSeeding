This repo describes microbial and chemical analyses from Cardozo et al. (DOI). Here, we studied the seeding of microbes and molecules from Arctic sea-ice to seawater during melt. We used ribosomal metabarcoding to assess microeukaryotic and prokaryotic community dynamics, coupled with FT-ICR-MS to identify chemical compounds. Raw sequence data is available at ENA under BioProjects XX (16S) and XX (18S). Raw FT-ICR-MS data (analyszed in script _Res5_DOM.R) is available under XX.
