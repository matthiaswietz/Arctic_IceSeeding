## Microbial and chemical signatures of melting sea-ice: export of bacteria, microeukaryotes, and molecules

This repo describes microbial and chemical analyses by [Cardozo and colleagues(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2026.105607), published in the special issue "LTER HAUSGARTEN". Here, we studied the seeding of microbes and molecules from Arctic sea-ice to seawater during melt. We used ribosomal metabarcoding to assess bacterial and microeukaryotic community dynamics, coupled with DOC / DOM data to identify chemical signatures. Raw sequence data is available under [BioProject PRJEB84955](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB84955). Raw DOM data, obtained via FT-ICR-MS, is available at [PANGAEA](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.978551).
