## Microbial and chemical signatures of melting sea-ice: export of bacteria, microeukaryotes, and molecules

This repo describes microbial and chemical analyses from Cardozo et al. (DOI). Here, we studied the seeding of microbes and molecules from Arctic sea-ice to seawater during melt. We used ribosomal metabarcoding to assess microeukaryotic and prokaryotic community dynamics, coupled with FT-ICR-MS to identify chemical compounds. Raw sequence data is available under [BioProject PRJEB84955](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB84955). Raw FT-ICR-MS data is available under XX.
